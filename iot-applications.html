    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I am Manav Singh currently pursuing my degree of software Engineering from chitkara University. In my previous units we have learnt a lot about different
      microcontrollers and how to operate them with different sensors to create a fully fledged project. I am really looking forward on working and creating 
      iot based applications.

    <div><h1> Topic 1 - IoT Applications</h1></div>

    
    <h2>IoT Apps </h2>
    <p> 
      Under the First activity we were asked about our general idea about what IoT Applications are and some key features that are needed for them to function.
      IoT applications work by connecting objects to eachohter and even use the connections of these objects with human beings(internet)
    </p>.
     <p>
       AI and machine learning algorithms are the most important aspect for these applications as these analyze big chunks of data from the connected sensors which provides real time data.
     the main focus for an IoT app would be to introduce automation by intergrating good quality sensors for better connectivity. some of the prominent exmaples of
     these applications would be our google assistant, alexa, smart tvs and many more.
    </p>
    <h2> Smart Buildings</h2>
    <p>
      if we talk about smart buildings the first thing that pops into mind is something with great security systems, automated parking system, automatated door, automatated
      heating and ventillation systems. a great example of this would be the edge building in amsterdam which is considered to be one of the most advenced buildings out there.
    </p>
    <p>
       we were asked how can we determine if something is smart. An object can be clasified as smart when there is no intervention or support required to perform a specific task. In
       layman language we can say that if the given task is automatated and efficient then the object is smart. It is something that can integrate into a network, analyze given 
       and can communicate with different technologies.  
    </p>
    <h2> Control Interface</h2>
    <p>
      the third topic that we got to know was the control interface. during the active learning session we discussed many points regarding what parts are needed, who are the users 
      and what features do we get from this. Because each time a user interacts with a particular device, the gadget retains that interaction as data, we can divide people into two 
      categories: recognised users and unrecognised users. The employees and clients in that particular example could be users, as we covered in the earlier activity on smart buildings.
      We can get some advanced characteristics from the environment as is. Examples include facial recognition, security, data analysis, the compactness of devices, smoke detection systems, 
      and intelligent parking systems. Many of these projects call for the construction or utilisation of various components, including solar panels, CMOS sensors, capacitive sensors, 
      smoke detectors, and software like the Azure SignalR service.
